# MKL-L01-SVM
This package is a set of Matlab scripts that implements the MKL_L01-SVM algorithm which is run on MATLAB R2003a. The related papers is titled MKL_L01-SVM.

This code is provided for a sake of result reproducibility. Most of the scripts are documented with a online matlab help and some demo scripts are provided.

The demo scripts are

   MKLL01SVM.m
   d_L_figure.m


MKLL01SVM.m  validated the accuracy (ACC) across different datasets, while d_l described the variations in the top three maximum values of d within two of those datasets.
