# MKL_L0-1_SVM
 This package is a set of Matlab scripts that implements the MKL-L01-SVM algorithm which is run on MATLAB R2003a. The  related papers  is titled "MKL-L01_SVM.

 This code is provided for a sake of result reproducibility. Most of the scripts are documented with a online matlab help and some demo scripts are provided.

 The demo scripts are

          MKLL01SVM.m 
          d_L_figure.m
          decision_boundary.m
          
  The "MKLL01SVM.m" validates the accuracy of the algorithm on different datasets.    The d_L_figure.m   reflects the variation of runtime as "d" changes. However, the "decision_boundary.m" demonstrates the classification situation on artificially synthesized data.
